While there's no definitive answer, Python offers several advantages:</p> <ul> <li> <p>User-Friendliness: Python code is clean and readable, using indentation rather than semicolons and curly braces to define code blocks. Simplified Memory Management: As an interpreted language, Python handles memory management for you, eliminating the need to declare data types or manage memory directly. Rapid Prototyping: Python allows for immediate code execution without the compile-and-flash steps required by languages like C++. MicroPython: The Power of Python on Microcontrollers</p> </li> <li> <p>MicroPython, created by Damien George, brings Python's simplicity and efficiency to hardware programming.
